Some quick notes about DEFCON this year.

## Critiques
- The venue was too bright.  Chillout rooms and talk tracks could have used a dimmer.
- Speaking of the Chillout room, it was somewhat disappointing. (I’m talking about Chillout 2, as Chillout 1 felt like a giant hospital waiting room).  I like a cavernous, dim, and ambient room for, you know, chilling out.  #SomaFM was over in the hallway, the Chillout room had a live stage, and it was overall pretty small. 

## “Best-ofs”

These are the best things I personally saw or were close to.  There’s so much going on that this just represents the best stuff I saw in *my fractional* DEFCON experience.

- **Best thing I learned:**  Gained a good bit of familiarity with [InspectAI](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai) at the [AI Village](https://aivillage.org/) as a part of their CTF.
- **Best Talk:**  “Librarian in Broad Daylight: Fighting back against ever encroaching capitalism”  by the [Cyberpunk Librarian](https://hackers.town/@CyberpunkLibrarian) in the War Stories track.
- **Best Rant:** Cory Doctorow on #enshittification
- **Best Tool or Technique:** [“MySQL honeypot that drops shells”](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2032/DEF%20CON%2032%20presentations/DEF%20CON%2032%20-%20Alexander%20Rubin%20Martin%20Rakhmanov%20-%20Atomic%20Honeypot%20A%20MySQL%20Honeypot%20That%20Drops%20Shells.pdf)
- **Best Research:** [“Watchers being watched: Exploiting the Surveillance System”](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2032/DEF%20CON%2032%20presentations/DEF%20CON%2032%20-%20Chanin%20Kim%20Myeonghun%20Pak%20Myeongjin%20Shin%20-%20Watchers%20being%20watched%20Exploiting%20the%20Surveillance%20System%20and%20its%20supply%20chain%20-%20DEMO%204.mp4 "DEF CON 32 - Chanin Kim Myeonghun Pak Myeongjin Shin - Watchers being watched Exploiting the Surveillance System and its supply chain - DEMO 4.mp4") in which the researchers exploited 4 different surveillance systems.
- **Best Real-World Impact:** “Bastardo Grande: Hunting the Largest Black Market Bike Fence In The World” by Bryan Hance.  Talk not up yet, see the related [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valleys-fanciest-stolen-bikes-trafficked-mastermind-jalisco-mexico/)
- **Best Contest:** There’s too many, but I loved the idea of Sn4ck3r, the machine that vends real items for captured flags.
- **Best Party:**  the 503 Party, of course!
- **Best Entertainment:** DJ Jackalope brought an awesome set after Hacker Jeopardy.  (and Skittish and Bus did a great job warming up the crowd just before)
- **Biggest Drama:** the [badge](https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/13/defcon_badge_disagreement_gets_physical/?td=rt-3a)
- **Best Village:** The Packet Hacking village due to the supreme DEFCON-y ambience and the well-run workshops they provided to people of all skill levels


## Observations & Random Points

1. I probably haven’t been to a main track talk in person for over 6 years.  I decided to go to a few of them and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  I’ll have to remember to put at least 2 on the agenda each year going forward.
2. BlueTeam Village got a much larger space this year.  I’m happy to see that, as they were nearly impossible to get into over at the Flamingo in recent years.  BTV is doing good work and people should be able to experience it.
3. There were *a lot* of contests. 
4. The Car-hacking village really brings it.  They had a semi truck rig, a Rivian, and they gave away a Tesla.  Well done, and my only ask is that we make it easier for people & mechanics to jail break their cars when the companies [John Deere-ify](https://www.wired.com/story/john-deere-tractor-jailbreak-defcon-2022/) them.



Next #DEFCON will be held Aug 7-10, 2025 at the LVCC.  I hope to see you there!
