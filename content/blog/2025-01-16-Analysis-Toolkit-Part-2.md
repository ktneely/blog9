# Intro

As I've documented in the [[about/index|about]] page, this site is the culmination of a lot of notes, articles, reports, and so on I've collected over the years.  Sometimes, I go back and review them and recently I came across the [Building an Analysis Toolkit - Part 1](https://swannysec.net/2015/10/10/building-an-analysis-toolkit.html) by John D. Swanson, or "Swannysec".  While reviewing this nearly 10 year old article, I caught some inspiration for two reasons:
1. I've been trying to figure out some ways to incorporate older notes into a new blogsite
2. John D. Swanson never wrote a part 2!
