The annual Verizon [Data Breach Investigation Report](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/T611/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf) is out, and along with it an accounting of the #cybersecurity compromise and data breach happenings for the past year.  As always, it's filled with data analysis and some trending commentary from the previous DBIR report.

The following is a TL;DR summary generated using [[Fabric]] by Daniel Miessler as a kind of experiment in how quickly and accurately we can distill a long report into usable information by using  an #LLM and a good prompt.


## ONE-SENTENCE-SUMMARY:
The 2024 DBIR reveals a significant rise in vulnerability exploitation and ransomware attacks, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity measures.

## TRENDS:
- Vulnerability exploitation tripled from last year, driven by zero-day vulnerabilities.
- Ransomware and extortion-related breaches accounted for 32% of all breaches.
- Human error remains a significant factor, involved in 68% of breaches.
- Third-party breaches increased by 68%, highlighting supply chain vulnerabilities.
- Errors, particularly misdelivery, are more prevalent than previously believed.
- Financially motivated attacks dominate, with ransomware and extortion leading the charge.
- The median loss from ransomware and extortion attacks was $46,000.
- Phishing remains a critical initial attack vector, with a notable increase in reporting rates.
- The use of stolen credentials and exploitation of vulnerabilities are top methods for system intrusion.
- The MOVEit vulnerability significantly impacted the threat landscape, affecting numerous industries.

## STATISTICS:
- 180% increase in attacks involving vulnerability exploitation.
- Ransomware accounts for 23% of breaches, with pure extortion at 9%.
- Human element involved in 68% of breaches.
- 15% of breaches involved third-party vulnerabilities.
- Errors contributed to 28% of breaches.
- Financial motives behind 92% of industries targeted by ransomware.
- Median loss from ransomware/extortion attacks is $46,000.
- 20% of users reported phishing attempts in simulations.
- Median time to click on a phishing email is 21 seconds.
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities as the initial breach action doubled from last year.

## QUOTES:
- "Ransomware and extortion-related threats continue to evolve, posing significant risks across industries."
- "The human element remains a critical vulnerability in cybersecurity defenses."
- "Supply chain vulnerabilities are increasingly being exploited by attackers."
- "Misdelivery errors highlight the ongoing challenge of human error in data breaches."
- "Financially motivated attacks dominate the cyber threat landscape."
- "The MOVEit vulnerability has had a profound impact on the cybersecurity threat landscape."
- "Increased reporting rates for phishing attempts indicate growing awareness among users."
- "The rapid response to phishing emails underscores the need for continuous user education."
- "Stolen credentials and vulnerability exploitation remain preferred methods for attackers."
- "The rise in third-party breaches underscores the importance of vendor security assessments."

## REFERENCES:
- MOVEit vulnerability
- FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) ransomware data
- Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA)
- VERIS Community Database (VCDB)

## RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement multi-factor authentication to mitigate the risk of stolen credentials.
- Regularly update and patch systems to protect against vulnerability exploitation.
- Conduct continuous phishing awareness training for all employees.
- Perform thorough security assessments of third-party vendors and suppliers.
- Deploy endpoint detection and response solutions to identify and mitigate ransomware attacks.
- Encourage the reporting of phishing attempts and provide clear reporting procedures.
- Utilize web application firewalls to protect against basic web application attacks.
- Establish robust data backup and recovery processes to minimize the impact of ransomware.
- Monitor for unusual activity indicating the misuse of privileges by internal actors.
