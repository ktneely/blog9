# About this Site and the Person Behind It


For a long time, I've kept notes in text with various markup formatting strategies, and this is the latest culmination of that.  A result of having gradually moved from Evernote to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) since around 2019, and there have been a bunch of steps along the way (RedNotebook, Cherrytree, Emacs org-mode, etc.).  I drafted up this site in late 2024 and have begin to post and upload content in earnest in 2025.

## What is Fifteen Standards

There are so many standards, frameworks, and platforms in information security, that the classic [XKCD](https://xkcd.com) comic about proliferating standards is a common joke during annual planning (and many other times).  While my site has a lot of specific information regarding tools and tactical practices, the impetus for finally publishing this information is to collect and publish my notes on creating or expanding security functions and leading teams.  Hence, some parts may end up looking like a framework, or -say it ain't so- a *standard.*
