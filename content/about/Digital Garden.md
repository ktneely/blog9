## What is a Digital Garden
I’m not exactly sure what a Digital Garden is, but in my mind, it’s a a place where information is constantly being added to and knowledge is always being expanded.  It’s a tool/location/construct that borrows from information-interlinking concepts such as those employed by wikis, [Zettlekasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), and blogs.  But unlike a blog, this should be a place that both the author and their readers revisit often: one where the author constantly adds both content and *context* to the corpus of information through both updating existing documents and adding additional, interlinked documents. 


The [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) has written a lot more about the nature of digital gardens than I will, so this is a useful article to gain a better understanding.  From the article:

The movement might be gaining steam now, but its roots date back to 1998, when Mark Bernstein introduced the idea of the “[hypertext garden](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html),” arguing for spaces on the internet that let a person wade into the unknown. “Gardens … lie between farmland and wilderness,” he [wrote](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Gardens.html). “The garden is farmland that delights the senses, designed for delight rather than commodity.” (His [digital garden](https://www.markbernstein.org/) includes a recent review of a Bay Area carbonara dish and reflections on his favorite essays.)
