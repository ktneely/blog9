# Infosec Notebook / Digital Garden


## Welcome to the Fifteenth Standard!

A site about information security, team-building, leadership, technology, and how those come together to deliver outcomes.  Also, sometimes some experiments and research, though those tend to be related to the above topics.

### Format

This site is essentially one part [[research|notes]], one part [[blog]], and one part second-brain for me and others to reference.  In the current parlance, this is a [[Digital Garden]], something I've been working toward for a while: an organic collection of material I've been typing at for years; content that is a mish-mash of thoughts, notes, and website bookmarks.   


### Navigation Tips

Sectional navigation is at the top and bottom of every page.  The primary sections are:
- [blog](../blog) 
- [[research/index|research topics]] - Notes. About topics. Topics of interest to me, and maybe to you.

### For the curious...

See the [[about/index|about]] pages for clues as to what this is all about.
