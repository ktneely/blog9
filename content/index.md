# A Digital (Astroturf)Garden


## Welcome!
This site is essentially one part [[research|notes]], one part [[blog]], and one part second-brain for me and others to reference.  In the current parlance, this is a [[Digital Garden]], something I've been working toward for a while: an organic collection of material I've been typing at for years.  


### Navigation Tips

Sectional navigation is at the top and bottom of every page.  The primary sections are:
- [blog](../blog) 
- [[research/index|research topics]] - Notes. About topics. 

### For the curious...

See the [[about/index|about]] pages for clues as to what this is all about.
