Test labs or HomeLabs are very important for fiddling with different technologies in order to learn and gain some familiarity in a safe environment.  Back in the day, this used to be a half or 1/3 rack using something like an [IKEA Lack rack](https://boingboing.net/2020/08/14/lack-rack-ikeas-cheapest-ta.html).  However, with a sufficiently powerful system, especially with plenty of RAM, an entire network can be stood up using [[VirtualMachines]] and Docker containers.  There are projects providing orchestrated setups for quick deployment.

Check out [The Homelab Almanac](https://taggartinstitute.org/p/the-homelab-almanac)  for a great, up-to-date guide on building and maintaining your own homelab.
